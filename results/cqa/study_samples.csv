Conversations: 
q0: what was, in millions, the operating income in 2017? 11503.0
q1: and what was it in 2016? 10815.0
q2: what was, then, the change over the year, in millions? 688.0
q3: and in the previous year, what was the decline in the net earnings, also in millions? 932.0
Question: what is that as a percentage of the 2015 net earnings?
Answer:",0.134,"To calculate the decline in net earnings as a percentage of the 2015 net earnings, we first need to determine the net earnings for 2015. The provided information does not include the net earnings for 2015 directly. However, we know the following:

- Net earnings attributable to PMI for 2017 were $6.0 billion.
- This amount represents a decrease of $932 million (13.4%) compared to the previous year (2016).

Using this information, we can backtrack to find the net earnings for 2016:

Net earnings for 2016 = Net earnings for 2017 + decrease in net earnings
Net earnings for 2016 = $6.0 billion + $932 million 
Net earnings for 2016 = $6.0 billion + $0.932 billion 
Net earnings for 2016 = $6.932 billion

Next, we can find the net earnings for 2015. Since the net earnings for 2016 were $6.932 billion and this was a 13.4% decrease from the previous year:

Let \( x \) be the net earnings for 2015.

The relation can be expressed as:
\[ 
6.932 = x - 0.134x \\
6.932 = 0.866x \\
x = \frac{6.932}{0.866} \\
x \approx 8.01 \text{ billion}
\]

So, the net earnings for 2015 were approximately $8.01 billion or $8010 million.

Now, we can calculate the decline in net earnings (which was $932 million) as a percentage of the 2015 net earnings:

Percentage decline = \(\frac{\text{decline in net earnings}}{\text{net earnings for 2015}} \times 100\)
\[
\text{Percentage decline} = \frac{932}{8010} \times 100 \approx 11.6\%
\]

Therefore, the decline in net earnings as a percentage of the 2015 net earnings is approximately **11.6%**.","To calculate the percentage decline in net earnings from 2016 to 2017, we first need the net earnings for 2015. However, the context does not provide this information. 

From the information provided:

- Net earnings attributable to PMI in 2017: $6.0 billion
- Decrease in net earnings from 2016 to 2017: $932 million

This means:
- Net earnings in 2016 can be calculated as follows:
  \[
  \text{Net earnings in 2016} = \text{Net earnings in 2017} + \text{Decrease}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Net earnings in 2016} = 6.0 \text{ billion} + 0.932 \text{ billion} = 6.932 \text{ billion}
  \]
  (or $6,932 million)

Next, we have to determine the decline in net earnings from 2016 to 2017 as a percentage of the 2015 net earnings, but we do not have the net earnings for 2015 in the provided context.

If we were hypothetically provided with the net earnings for 2015, we could calculate the percentage decrease by using the following formula:
\[
\text{Percentage decline} = \left( \frac{\text{Decrease}}{\text{Net earnings in 2015}} \right) \times 100
\]

Since we do not have the net earnings for 2015, we cannot compute the exact percentage decline. More information is required to provide a specific numeric answer. 

Please provide the net earnings for 2015 to proceed with the calculation."

Question: and what is that in billions?
Answer:",6.95522,"The 2015 earnings, in millions, were approximately 6955.22. To convert this figure to billions, we divide by 1000.

\[ 
6955.22388 \, \text{million} \div 1000 = 6.95522388 \, \text{billion} 
\]

Therefore, the earnings for 2015 are approximately **$6.96 billion**.","To find the 2015 net earnings in billions, we first need to use the information from the previous questions and answers.

From previous answers:
- The decline in net earnings from 2016 to 2017 was $932 million.
- Net earnings attributable to PMI in 2017 were $6.0 billion.

To find the 2016 net earnings, we add the decline back to the 2017 earnings:
Net earnings in 2016 = Net earnings in 2017 + Decline  
Net earnings in 2016 = $6,000 million + $932 million  
Net earnings in 2016 = $6,932 million.

Now, if we follow up with the decline from 2015 (let's denote it as X):
- We would have to look at the decline of net earnings from 2015 to 2016 to find 2015 earnings as:
Net earnings in 2016 = Net earnings in 2015 - Decline (from 2015 to 2016).

Given the decline in 2016:
We know the decline to be 13.4%. 

Net earnings in 2016 = Net earnings in 2015 (1 - 0.134)

So,
$6,932 million = Net earnings in 2015 * (1 - 0.134)  
=> $6,932 million = Net earnings in 2015 * 0.866  
=> Net earnings in 2015 = $6,932 million / 0.866  
=> Net earnings in 2015 ≈ $8,005.36 million.

Now we convert this amount from millions to billions:
Net earnings in 2015 in billions = $8,005.36 million / 1,000 = $8.00536 billion.

So the final answer is approximately:
**$8.01 billion** (rounded to two decimal places)."

Conversations: 
q0: in the year of 2008, what was the variance of the foreign exchange products in the first section? 4.4
q1: and what was it in the second section? 3.3
Question: what was, then, the combined total variance for both sections?
Answer:",7.7,"To find the combined total variance for both sections, we simply add the variances calculated for each section.

From the previous conversations:
- Variance of foreign exchange products in the first section: 4.4
- Variance in the second section: 3.3

Now, we add the two variances together:

Combined Total Variance = 4.4 + 3.3 = 7.7

Therefore, the combined total variance for both sections is **7.7**.","To calculate the combined total variance for both sections related to foreign exchange products in 2008, we'll first determine the variance from both provided sections.

From the first section:
- **2008 Annual Average**: $1.8 million
- **2008 Maximum**: $4.7 million
- **2008 Minimum**: $0.3 million

Variance is calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Variance} = \frac{\sum (x_i - \mu)^2}{N} \]
where \( \mu \) is the mean, \( x_i \) are the data points, and \( N \) is the number of data points.

The mean \( (\mu) \) is calculated as:
\[ \mu = \frac{(1.8 + 4.7 + 0.3)}{3} = \frac{6.8}{3} = 2.267 \]

Now we calculate the squared differences from the mean:
- For $1.8: \quad (1.8 - 2.267)^2 = (-0.467)^2 = 0.218 \approx 0.218\$
- For $4.7: \quad (4.7 - 2.267)^2 = (2.433)^2 = 5.916 \approx 5.916\$
- For $0.3: \quad (0.3 - 2.267)^2 = (-1.967)^2 = 3.866 \approx 3.866\$

Now sum these squared differences:
\[ \text{Sum} = 0.218 + 5.916 + 3.866 = 10.000 \]

Now divide by \( N \):
\[ \text{Variance} = \frac{10.000}{3} \approx 3.333 \]

From the second section, we use the same method with:
- 2008 Annual Average: $1.8 million
- 2008 Maximum: $4.0 million
- 2008 Minimum: $0.7 million

Calculating the mean:
\[ \mu = \frac{(1.8 + 4.0 + 0.7)}{3} = \frac{6.5}{3} = 2.167 \]

Now calculate squared differences:
- For $1.8: \quad (1.8 - 2.167)^2 = (-0.367)^2 = 0.135 \approx 0.135\$
- For $4.0: \quad (4.0 - 2.167)^2 = (1.833)^2 = 3.356 \approx 3.356\$
- For $0.7: \quad (0.7 - 2.167)^2 = (-1.467)^2 = 2.157 \approx 2.157\$

Sum these squared differences:
\[ \text{Sum} = 0.135 + 3.356 + 2.157 = 5.648 \]

Calculate the variance:
\[ \text{Variance} = \frac{5.648}{3} \approx 1.883 \]

Now we can find the combined total variance for both sections:
\[ \text{Combined Total Variance} = 3.333 + 1.883 \approx 5.216 \]

Thus, the answer to the question is:
**Answer:** 5.216 million."

Question: and what was the average variance between them?
Answer:",3.85,"To find the average variance between the two sections for the year 2008, we first need to add the variances from both sections and then divide by the number of sections.

1. Variance from the first section (foreign exchange products): 4.4
2. Variance from the second section (interest-rate products): 3.3

Combined total variance = 4.4 + 3.3 = 7.7

Now, to find the average variance between the two sections:

Average variance = Combined total variance / Number of sections
Average variance = 7.7 / 2 = 3.85

Therefore, the average variance between them is **3.85**.","To find the average variance between the two sections of the foreign exchange products for the year 2008, we can first identify the variance (which is represented by the values in the table) for both sections:

1. **First Section (2008 annual averages)**: 
   - Foreign exchange products: $1.8 million

2. **Second Section (2008 maximum)**: 
   - Foreign exchange products: $4.7 million

Now, we can compute the average of these two values:

\[
\text{Average Variance} = \frac{\text{First Section} + \text{Second Section}}{2}
\]
\[
\text{Average Variance} = \frac{1.8 + 4.7}{2} = \frac{6.5}{2} = 3.25

q0: what was the amount of notes maturing in june 2022? 750.0
q1: and the maturity amount due in 2017? 700.0
Question: combined, what is the total of these two values?
Answer:",1450.0,"To find the total of the two values provided in the questions (the amount of notes maturing in June 2022 and the maturity amount due in 2017), we simply add them together:

- Amount of notes maturing in June 2022: $750 million
- Maturity amount due in 2017: $700 million

Total = $750 million + $700 million = $1,450 million

So, the total combined amount is **$1,450 million** or **$1.45 billion**.","To find the combined total of the notes maturing in June 2022 and the maturity amount due in 2017, we first extract the values from the context provided.

1. **Maturity amount due in June 2022**: From the context, we see that the company has $750 million in 3.375% notes maturing in June 2022. 
   - **Value from q0**: $750 million.

2. **Maturity amount due in 2017**: From the context, the company has $700 million in 6.25% notes due in 2017.
   - **Value from q1**: $700 million.

Now we add these two amounts together:

\[
750 \text{ million} + 700 \text{ million} = 1450 \text{ million}
\]

Thus, the combined total is **$1,450 million** or **$1.45 billion**."

q1: what is the value for 2006? 75896.0
Question: what is the total sum including all 3 years?
Answer:",1041531.0,"To find the total sum of long-term debt due in 2004, 2005, and 2006, we will add the values from these years together.

From the previous answers:
- Long-term debt due in 2004 = $503,215,000
- Long-term debt due in 2005 = $462,420,000
- Long-term debt due in 2006 = $75,896,000

Now, we calculate the total:

\[
503,215 + 462,420 + 75,896 = 1,041,531 \text{ (in thousands)}
\]

Thus, the total sum including all three years is:

q0: what's the portion of fair value to carrying value? 1.07513
q1: so what percentage higher is fair value than carrying value? 0.07513
Question: what is the fair value of all notes due in 2015 and 2017?
Answer:",1538.0,"To find the fair value of all notes due in 2015 and 2017, we need to look at the notes specified:

1. **2015 Notes**: 
   - Maturity Amount: $750 million
   - Fair Value: $753 million

2. **2017 Notes**: 
   - Maturity Amount: $700 million
   - Fair Value: $785 million

Now, we add the fair values of these notes together:

\[
\text{Fair Value of 2015 Notes} + \text{Fair Value of 2017 Notes} = 753 + 785 = 1,538 \text{ million}
\]

Thus, the fair value of all notes due in 2015 and 2017 is **$1.538 billion**.","To determine the fair value of all notes due in 2015 and 2017, we need to extract the relevant information from the provided table data. Here are the notes and their fair values:

1. **2015 Notes** (1.375% notes due 2015):
   - Fair value: $753 million

2. **2017 Notes** (6.25% notes due 2017):
   - Fair value: $785 million

Now, we simply add the fair values of these notes together:

\[ 
\text{Total Fair Value} = \text{Fair Value of 2015 Notes} + \text{Fair Value of 2017 Notes} 
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[ 
\text{Total Fair Value} = 753 \, \text{million} + 785 \, \text{million} = 1538 \, \text{million}

Answer:",20.74359,"The total amount of cash outflow used for shares repurchased during November 2007 was approximately $20,743,588.70, which is equivalent to $20.74 million when rounded to two decimal places.","To calculate the total amount of cash outflow used for shares repurchased during November 2007, we need the average price paid per share and the total number of shares repurchased during that month.

From the provided information, during November 2007, the company repurchased:
- Total number of shares purchased from October 29 to November 25, 2007: **431,170** shares at an average price of **$48.11**.
- The number of shares purchased from November 26 to December 31, 2007: **8,310** shares at an average price of **$44.99**.

Now we will calculate the cash outflow for each of those periods and then sum them up:

1. **For October 29 to November 25 (431,170 shares at $48.11):**
   - Cash outflow = 431,170 shares × $48.11/share = **$20,755,968.70**

2. **For November 26 to December 31 (8,310 shares at $44.99):**
   - Cash outflow = 8,310 shares × $44.99/share = **$373,583.90**

Now, we sum these two amounts:
- Total cash outflow = $20,755,968.70 + $373,583.90 = **$21,129,552.60**

To express this amount in millions of dollars:
- Total cash outflow in millions = $21,129,552.60 ÷ 1,000,000 = **$21.13 million** (rounded to two decimal places).

Therefore, the answer to the question, ""and how much is that in dollars?"" is:

2. Capital expenditures on a GAAP basis in 2012: $2,559.8 million (as per the provided table).

Next, we calculate the ratio of non-GAAP to GAAP capital expenditures:

Conversations: 
q0: what was the final aggregate purchase price of all towers, in millions of dollars? 173.2
q1: and how much is that in dollars? 173200000.0
Question: what was, then, the average price paid for each tower?
Answer:",180041.58004,"To determine the average price paid for each tower, we can divide the total aggregate purchase price by the number of towers acquired.

The total purchase price is $173.2 million, which is equivalent to $173,200,000. The number of communications sites (towers) acquired is 962.

Now, we can calculate the average price per tower:

\[
\text{Average price per tower} = \frac{\text{Total purchase price}}{\text{Number of towers}} = \frac{173200000}{962} \approx 180000.00
\]

Therefore, the average price paid for each tower is approximately **$180,000**.","To find the average price paid for each tower, we need to sum the aggregate purchase prices of the towers from both acquisitions and then divide that by the total number of towers acquired.

From the context provided:

1. **Uganda Acquisition**: 
   - Purchase Price: $173.2 million
   - Number of Towers: 962

2. **Germany Acquisition**: 
   - Purchase Price: $525.7 million
   - Number of Towers: 2031

### Step 1: Calculate the total purchase price
Total Purchase Price = Uganda Purchase Price + Germany Purchase Price  
= $173.2 million + $525.7 million  
= $698.9 million

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of towers
Total Number of Towers = Uganda Towers + Germany Towers  
= 962 + 2031  
= 2993

### Step 3: Calculate the average price paid per tower
Average Price per Tower = Total Purchase Price / Total Number of Towers  
= $698.9 million / 2993  
≈ $233,500 (rounded to the nearest dollar)

Thus, the average price paid for each tower is approximately **$233,500**."

Conversations: 
q0: what was the total of contingent payments related to impella? 16750002.0
q1: and concerning the state tax settlement, what was its total due payment, in millions? 168.0
Question: considering the number of years over which it was to be paid, what was its annual average cost?
Answer:",56.0,"To calculate the annual average cost of the state tax settlement, we start with the total due payment which is $168 million. 

Assuming the settlement covers the tax years that were mentioned (2003, 2004, and 2005), this indicates a total of 3 years.

Now, we calculate the annual average cost as follows:

\[
\text{Annual Average Cost} = \frac{\text{Total Due Payment}}{\text{Number of Years}} = \frac{168 \text{ million}}{3}
\]

\[
\text{Annual Average Cost} = 56 \text{ million}
\]

Thus, the annual average cost of the state tax settlement is **$56 million.**","To determine the annual average cost of the contingent payments related to the acquisition of Impella, we need to calculate the total of those payments and divide that by the number of years over which the payments were to be made.

From the information provided in the context:
- Total payments due upon FDA approvals and sales milestones:
  - FDA approval of the Impella 2.5 device: $5,583,333
  - FDA approval of the Impella 5.0 device: $5,583,333
  - Sale of 1,000 units of Impella’s products worldwide: $5,583,334

We can add these amounts to find the total contingent payments:
Total = $5,583,333 + $5,583,333 + $5,583,334 = $16,750,000

Now, we need to consider how many years these payments were expected to cover. The text does not specify an explicit duration over which these payments were made, but it does mention that the milestones related to the sales and FDA approval were achieved prior to March 31, 2009. Assuming the acquisition occurred in 2008 (the year of the context), and the payments culminated by March 31, 2009, this suggests that the payments occurred over a single fiscal year.

Thus, if we consider it took approximately one year to fulfill these milestones, the average annual cost of contingent payments would simply be:

Annual Average Cost = Total Contingent Payments / Number of Years
Annual Average Cost = $16,750,000 / 1 = $16,750,000

Therefore, the annual average cost of the contingent payments is **$16.75 million**."

q0: what portion of the long-term debt is reported under the current liabilities section of the balance sheet as of 9/28/08? 0.01748
Question: what portion of the total contractual obligations are due within the next year?
Answer:",0.05793,"To calculate the portion of the total contractual obligations that are due within the next year, first, we need to extract the amount due within the next year from the provided table.

From the table summarized in the context:

Next, we need to find the total contractual obligations amount from the table:

- Total contractual obligations: **$2,702,687**

Now, we can calculate the portion of the total contractual obligations due within the next year:

\[
\text{Portion due within next year} = \frac{\text{Obligations due within next year}}{\text{Total contractual obligations}} = \frac{156,571}{2,702,687}

Question: what is that less the value of assets related to the firm 2019s reinsurance business which were classified as held for sale as of december 2012?
Answer:",3.464,"To find the answer, we start with the value of miscellaneous receivables and other assets in 2012, which is 20.234 billion. 

Next, we subtract the value of assets related to the firm's reinsurance business classified as held for sale as of December 2012, which is 16.77 billion.

Now, perform the calculation:

20.234 billion - 16.77 billion = 3.464 billion.

Therefore, the answer is 3.464 billion.","To find the value less the assets related to the firm's reinsurance business classified as held for sale as of December 2012, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the value of miscellaneous receivables and other assets in 2012 from the table**:
   - Miscellaneous receivables and other assets = $20,234 million.

2. **Divide this value by 100** (as per q0):
   - $20,234 million / 100 = $202.34 million.

3. **Identify the value of assets related to the firm's reinsurance business classified as held for sale as of December 2012**:
   - These assets amount to $16,770 million.

4. **Subtract the value of the reinsurance business assets from the computed value**:
   - $202.34 million - $16,770 million = $202.34 million - $16,770 million (note we need to convert both to the same units).
   - Convert $202.34 million into millions by keeping it as is for easy calculation to the total: therefore it's still $202.34 million.

5. **Perform the subtraction**:
   - The cumulative amount = $202.34 million - $16,770 million = -$16,567.66 million.

Thus, the answer to the question is:
**- $16,567.66 million**."

Please take into account the information provided in the preceding questions and their answers when formulating your response:
Context: the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee . the following is a discussion of the more significant assumptions , estimates , accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements : 2022 revenue recognition - we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists , delivery of product has occurred , the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured . for our company , this means that revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss is transferred to our customers . title transfers to our customers upon shipment or upon receipt at the customer's location as determined by the sales terms for each transaction . the company estimates the cost of sales returns based on historical experience , and these estimates are normally immaterial . 2022 goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets valuation - we test goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur that would warrant such review . we perform our annual impairment analysis in the first quarter of each year . while the company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment for both goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment exists , the company elects to perform the quantitative assessment for our annual impairment analysis . the impairment analysis involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or non-amortizable intangible asset to the carrying value . if the carrying value exceeds the fair value , goodwill or a non-amortizable intangible asset is considered impaired . to determine the fair value of goodwill , we primarily use a discounted cash flow model , supported by the market approach using earnings multiples of comparable global and local companies within the tobacco industry . at december 31 , 2015 , the carrying value of our goodwill was $ 7.4 billion , which is related to ten reporting units , each of which is comprised of a group of markets with similar economic characteristics . the estimated fair value of our ten reporting units exceeded the carrying value as of december 31 , 2015 . to determine the fair value of non-amortizable intangible assets , we primarily use a discounted cash flow model applying the relief-from-royalty method . we concluded that the fair value of our non-amortizable intangible assets exceeded the carrying value , and any reasonable movement in the assumptions would not result in an impairment . these discounted cash flow models include management assumptions relevant for forecasting operating cash flows , which are subject to changes in business conditions , such as volumes and prices , costs to produce , discount rates and estimated capital needs . management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values are estimated , and we believe these assumptions are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use . since the march 28 , 2008 , spin-off from altria , we have not recorded a charge to earnings for an impairment of goodwill or non-amortizable intangible assets . 2022 marketing and advertising costs - we incur certain costs to support our products through programs which include advertising , marketing , consumer engagement and trade promotions . the costs of our advertising and marketing programs are expensed in accordance with u.s . gaap . recognition of the cost related to our consumer engagement and trade promotion programs contain uncertainties due to the judgment required in estimating the potential performance and compliance for each program . for volume-based incentives provided to customers , management continually assesses and estimates , by customer , the likelihood of the customer achieving the specified targets and records the reduction of revenue as the sales are made . for other trade promotions , management relies on estimated utilization rates that have been developed from historical experience . changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual marketing program would not result in a material change in our financial position , results of operations or operating cash flows . we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to estimate our marketing programs during the past three years . 2022 employee benefit plans - as discussed in item 8 , note 13 . benefit plans to our consolidated financial statements , we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees , including pensions , postretirement health care and postemployment benefits ( primarily severance ) . we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by u.s . gaap . these calculations include various actuarial assumptions , such as discount rates , assumed rates of return on plan assets , compensation increases , mortality , turnover rates and health care cost trend rates . we review actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so . as permitted by u.s . gaap , any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods . we believe that the assumptions utilized in calculating our obligations under these plans are reasonable based upon our historical experience and advice from our actuaries . weighted-average discount rate assumptions for pensions and postretirement plans are as follows: . <table class='wikitable'><tr><td>1</td><td></td><td>2015</td><td>2014</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>u.s . pension plans</td><td>4.30% ( 4.30 % )</td><td>3.95% ( 3.95 % )</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>non-u.s . pension plans</td><td>1.68% ( 1.68 % )</td><td>1.92% ( 1.92 % )</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>postretirement plans</td><td>4.45% ( 4.45 % )</td><td>4.20% ( 4.20 % )</td></tr></table> we anticipate that assumption changes , coupled with decreased amortization of deferred losses , will decrease 2016 pre-tax u.s . and non- u.s . pension and postretirement expense to approximately $ 209 million as compared with approximately $ 240 million in 2015 , excluding .

- The difference between the two rates (from q2) is:
  \( 4.30\% - 3.95\% = 0.35\% \) or **0.0035** in decimal form.

Now, we need to divide the difference by the 2014 value:

\[
\text{Difference divided by the 2014 value} = \frac{0.35\%}{3.95\%} = \frac{0.0035}{0.0395} \approx 0.0886
\]

Therefore, the final answer is approximately:

**0.0886**."

q0: what was the total of u.s . dollar notes issued in 2014 and that matured in either 2024 or 2044, in millions? 1500.0
Question: including the u.s . dollar notes that matured in 2017, what then becomes that total, in millions?
Answer:",2000.0,"To find the total of U.S. dollar notes issued in 2014, including those that matured in 2017, we will add the U.S. dollar notes that mature in both 2017 and 2024 or 2044.

From the previous response:
- U.S. dollar notes that matured in 2024 or 2044: $750 million (maturing in 2024) + $750 million (maturing in 2044) = $1500 million.
- U.S. dollar notes maturing in 2017: $500 million.

Now, we add the amounts together:
- Total = $1500 million + $500 million = $2000 million.

So, the total of U.S. dollar notes issued in 2014, including those that matured in 2017, is **$2000 million**.","To determine the total of U.S. dollar notes issued in 2014 that matured in either 2024 or 2044, we will examine the provided data:

1. U.S. dollar notes (maturing in **2024**):
   - Face Value: $750 million (interest rate 3.250%, issued in November 2014)
   
2. U.S. dollar notes (maturing in **2044**):
   - Face Value: $750 million (interest rate 4.250%, issued in November 2014)

Adding these amounts together:
- $750 million (2024) + $750 million (2044) = **$1500 million**

Now, we also need to include the U.S. dollar notes that matured in **2017**:
- U.S. dollar notes (maturing in **2017**):
   - Face Value: $500 million (interest rate 1.250%, issued in November 2014)

Now adding this to the previous total:
- $1500 million + $500 million = **$2000 million**

Thus, the final answer is: **$2000 million**."

q1: what is the 2016 low price? 27.09
Question: what is the sum?
Answer:",60.0,"To find the sum, we need to add the high price in 2016 ($32.91) and the low price in 2016 ($27.09).

Calculating the sum:

\[ 
32.91 + 27.09 = 60.00 
\]

Therefore, the sum is **60.00**.","To answer the question about the sum, we need to first extract the high and low prices from the provided table data.

From the table:

- The high price in 2016 is **$34.50** (as noted for the second quarter).
- The low price in 2016 is **$16.75** (as noted for the year).

Now, we calculate the sum of these two values:

\[
\text{Sum} = \text{High Price} + \text{Low Price} = 34.50 + 16.75 = 51.25

Thus, the sum is **$51.25**."

Therefore, the sum including the 2013 value is **$43,100 million**.","To find the sum of the average backlog at year-end for the years 2013, 2014, and 2015, we first extract the backlog values from the provided table:

- Backlog at year-end 2013: $14,300 million
- Backlog at year-end 2014: $13,300 million
- Backlog at year-end 2015: $15,500 million

Next, we calculate the average backlog for the years 2014 and 2015:

Average backlog for 2014 and 2015:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Backlog 2014} + \text{Backlog 2015}}{2} = \frac{13300 + 15500}{2} = \frac{28800}{2} = 14400 \text{ million}
\]

Now, to find the sum including the 2013 value:
\[
\text{Sum} = \text{Backlog 2013} + \text{Average Backlog (2014, 2015)} = 14300 + 14400 = 28700 \text{ million}

q2: what was it for 2015? 750.0
q3: what was, then, the total carrying value for both years? 1750.0
Question: and including the 2017 notes, what becomes this total?
Answer:",2448.0,"To find the total carrying value for the notes due in 2014, 2015, and now including the 2017 notes, we can start by extracting the carrying values from the data provided:

1. Carrying value for notes due in 2014: $1,000 million (from q1).
2. Carrying value for notes due in 2015: $750 million (from q2).
3. Carrying value for notes due in 2017: $698 million (as provided in the table).

Now, we sum these amounts:

Total carrying value = Carrying value (2014) + Carrying value (2015) + Carrying value (2017)

From the context:
- The accrued value of tax-related interest and penalties at December 31, 2011, was approximately $16 million (answer0).
- The decrease recognized in the tax-related interest and penalties during the year was $3 million (answer1).

Now let's calculate the prior sum, which is the accrued value before the decrease:
- Prior sum = Accrued value - Decrease = $16 million - $3 million = $13 million (answer2).

Now, we can perform the final calculation:
- Decreased value (from the year) = $3 million (answer1).
- Prior sum = $13 million (answer2).

Now we divide the decreased value by the prior sum:
\[

q0: what was the variance in the price of shares in the first quarter of 2002? 13.73
Question: and what was it in that same period in 2001?
Answer:",18.85,"In the first quarter of 2001, the high price of the common stock was $60.15 and the low price was $41.30. The variance in the price of shares can be calculated as follows:

Variance = High Price - Low Price  
Variance = $60.15 - $41.30  
Variance = $18.85  

Therefore, the variance in the price of shares in the first quarter of 2001 was $18.85.","To calculate the variance in the price of shares for the first quarter of 2002 and 2001, we first need to find the high and low prices for those periods from the provided data.

For the first quarter of 2002:
- High Price: $17.84
- Low Price: $4.11

The variance can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Variance} = \frac{(X - \mu)^2 + (Y - \mu)^2}{n}
\]

Where:
- \(X\) is the high price,
- \(Y\) is the low price,
- \(\mu\) is the mean price,
- \(n\) is the number of data points (in this case, 2).

First, we calculate the mean (\(\mu\)) for 2002:
\[
\mu = \frac{High + Low}{2} = \frac{17.84 + 4.11}{2} = \frac{21.95}{2} = 10.975
\]

Now, we calculate the variance for 2002:
\[
\text{Variance}_{2002} = \frac{(17.84 - 10.975)^2 + (4.11 - 10.975)^2}{2}
\]
Calculating each term:
\[
(17.84 - 10.975)^2 = (6.865)^2 = 47.142225
\]
\[
(4.11 - 10.975)^2 = (-6.865)^2 = 47.142225
\]
So,
\[
\text{Variance}_{2002} = \frac{47.142225 + 47.142225}{2} = \frac{94.28445}{2} = 47.142225
\]

Now, for the first quarter of 2001:
- High Price: $60.15
- Low Price: $41.30

Calculating the mean (\(\mu\)):
\[
\mu = \frac{60.15 + 41.30}{2} = \frac{101.45}{2} = 50.725
\]

Now, we calculate the variance for 2001:
\[
\text{Variance}_{2001} = \frac{(60.15 - 50.725)^2 + (41.30 - 50.725)^2}{2}
\]
Calculating each term:
\[
(60.15 - 50.725)^2 = (9.425)^2 = 88.683625
\]
\[
(41.30 - 50.725)^2 = (-9.425)^2 = 88.683625
\]
So,
\[
\text{Variance}_{2001} = \frac{88.683625 + 88.683625}{2} = \frac{177.36725}{2} = 88.683625
\]

Therefore, the variances for the first quarter of each year are:
- Variance for 2002: **47.14**
- Variance for 2001: **88.68**"

q2: what was, then, the change over the year? 16.8
q3: what was the total liability by the end of 2008? 29.6
Question: and how much does that change represent in relation to this 2008 total liability?
Answer:",0.56757,"To determine how much the change from the end of 2007 to the end of 2008 represents in relation to the total liability at the end of 2008, we can use the following formula:

\[
\text{Percentage Change} = \left(\frac{\text{Change}}{\text{Total Liability at Year End}} \right) \times 100
\]

From the previous answers:
- Change from the end of 2007 to the end of 2008 = \( 16.8 \) million
- Total liability at the end of 2008 = \( 29.6 \) million

Now, substituting the values into the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage Change} = \left(\frac{16.8}{29.6}\right) \times 100 \approx 56.76\%
\]

Thus, the change represents approximately **56.76%** of the total liability at the end of 2008.","To find out how much the change from the end of 2007 to the end of 2008 represents in relation to the total liability by the end of 2008, we first need to determine the values mentioned.

From the information provided:

1. **Total liability at the end of 2007**: $29.6 million (from the table).
2. **Total liability at the end of 2008**: $12.8 million (from the table).

Now, we calculate the change in liability over the year 2008:

\[
\text{Change} = \text{Liability at 31-Dec-2008} - \text{Liability at 31-Dec-2007} = 12.8 - 29.6 = -16.8 \text{ million}
\]

Now, we need to express this change in relation to the total liability at the end of 2008:

\[
\text{Change as a fraction of 2008 total liability} = \frac{\text{Change}}{\text{Total liability at 31-Dec-2008}} = \frac{-16.8}{12.8}
\]

Calculating that gives:

\[
\frac{-16.8}{12.8} = -1.3125
\]

To express it as a percentage:

\[
-1.3125 \times 100 = -131.25\%
\]

Thus, the change of -$16.8 million represents approximately **-131.25%** of the total liability at the end of 2008. 

Final Answer: The change represents approximately **-131.25%** of the total liability at the end of 2008."

q0: what portion of the company owned facilities are in europe? 0.13253
Question: at 12/31/16 what percentage of manufacturing and processing facilities are leased?
Answer:",0.04598,"To calculate the percentage of manufacturing and processing facilities that are leased as of December 31, 2016, we first need to identify the total number of facilities (both owned and leased) and the total number of leased facilities.

From the provided data:
- Total number of manufacturing and processing facilities = 87
- Number of leased facilities = 4

Now we can calculate the percentage of leased facilities using the following formula:

\[
\text{Percentage of leased facilities} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of leased facilities}}{\text{Total number of facilities}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the numbers:

\[
\text{Percentage of leased facilities} = \left( \frac{4}{87} \right) \times 100 \approx 4.6\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of manufacturing and processing facilities that are leased as of December 31, 2016, is approximately **4.6%**.","To determine the percentage of manufacturing and processing facilities that are leased as of December 31, 2016, we can use the information provided in the context.

Total manufacturing and processing facilities = 87  
Total leased facilities = 4 (United States) + 2 (Rest of World) = 6 leased facilities

Now, we can calculate the percentage of leased facilities using the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage of leased facilities} = \left( \frac{\text{Total leased facilities}}{\text{Total manufacturing facilities}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting in the numbers:

\[
\text{Percentage of leased facilities} = \left( \frac{6}{87} \right) \times 100 \approx 6.90\%
\]

Therefore, as of December 31, 2016, approximately **6.90%** of the manufacturing and processing facilities are leased."

q3: and between that year and the previous, 2010, what was the change in the fair value of the full unrealized losses? 17951.0
Question: what is this change as a percentage of that fair value in 2010?
Answer:",0.21923,"To calculate the change in the fair value of the full unrealized losses as a percentage of that fair value in 2010, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the fair value in 2010**: The fair value in 2010 was $81,881 million (as indicated in the table).

2. **Identify the change in the fair value of the unrealized losses**: The change calculated in the previous query (q3) was $17,951 million.

3. **Calculate the percentage change**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage change} = \left( \frac{\text{Change in fair value}}{\text{Fair value in 2010}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Substituting the values:

   \]

4. **Perform the calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage change} \approx 21.9 \%

Therefore, the change in the fair value of the full unrealized losses as a percentage of that fair value in 2010 is approximately **21.9%**.","To determine the change in fair value of the full unrealized losses as a percentage of that fair value in 2010, we first need to gather the necessary values:

1. **Net unrealized loss pre-tax in 2010**: $-448 million (which represents losses).
2. **Net unrealized loss pre-tax in 2011**: $-181 million.

Now, to find the change in the fair value of the unrealized losses between 2010 and 2011:

Change in unrealized losses = Unrealized loss in 2011 - Unrealized loss in 2010
= $-181 million - $-448 million 
= $-181 million + $448 million 
= $267 million.

Next, we need to calculate the change as a percentage of the fair value in 2010. The fair value in 2010 was $81,881 million.

Percentage change = (Change in unrealized losses / Fair value in 2010) * 100
= ($267 million / $81,881 million) * 100
≈ 0.325%.

Therefore, the change in unrealized losses as a percentage of the fair value in 2010 is approximately **0.325%**."

q0: what was the change in the amortization expense from 2007 to 2008? 3.9
Question: and how much does this change represent in relation to that amortization expense in 2007, in percentage?
Answer:",0.04239,"To determine how much the change in amortization expense from 2007 to 2008 represents in relation to the amortization expense in 2007, we need the amortization expenses for both years. 

From the provided information, we have:

- Amortization expense for 2007: $92.0 million
- Change in amortization from 2007 to 2008: $3.9 million

Now we can calculate the new amortization expense for 2008:

Amortization expense for 2008 = Amortization expense for 2007 - Change
= $92.0 million - $3.9 million
= $88.1 million

Next, we will calculate the percentage change relative to the 2007 amortization expense:

Percentage change = (Change / Amortization expense for 2007) * 100
= ($3.9 million / $92.0 million) * 100
≈ 4.24%

Therefore, the change in amortization expense from 2007 to 2008 represents approximately **4.24%** of the amortization expense in 2007.","To calculate the change in amortization expense from 2007 to 2008, we first need the values from the provided information. 

According to the context, the amortization expenses are projected as follows:
- Amortization expense for 2007: $92.0 million
- Amortization expense for 2008: $90.5 million

Now we find the change in amortization expense:

Change = Amortization Expense (2008) - Amortization Expense (2007)
Change = $90.5 million - $92.0 million
Change = -$1.5 million

Next, we determine how much this change represents in relation to the amortization expense in 2007, in percentage:

Percentage Change = (Change / Amortization Expense in 2007) * 100
Percentage Change = (-$1.5 million / $92.0 million) * 100
Percentage Change = -0.016304347826087 * 100
Percentage Change = -1.6304347826087

Rounding this to two decimal places gives us:

**Answer: Approximately -1.63%**. 

This indicates a decrease of about 1.63% in amortization expense from 2007 to 2008."

Thus, the answer is approximately 0.11491.","To find the answer to the question ""what is that less 1?"", we first need the ratio of 2005 to 2004 which corresponds to your prior queries.

From the context provided:
- The balance of accumulated depreciation and amortization at the end of 2005 is $663,750,000 (from q0).
- The balance at the end of 2004 is $595,338,000 (from q1).

Now, the ratio of 2005 to 2004 (from q2) can be calculated as follows:

q0: what was the purchase price, net of what cash was acquired? 102.0
q1: and including the impact of inventories? 268.0
Question: and prepaid expenses and other?
Answer:",273.0,"To calculate the adjusted purchase price of the acquisition considering prepaid expenses and other assets, we start from the previously calculated purchase price of $268 million, which included the impact of inventories.

The value of prepaid expenses and other is given as $5 million. Since this asset contributes positively to the acquisition, we add it to the previous total.

Thus, the calculation would be:

$268 million (purchase price after inventories) + $5 million (prepaid expenses) = $273 million.

Therefore, the adjusted purchase price, net of cash acquired, and including the impact of inventories and prepaid expenses and other is **$273 million**.","To determine the purchase price net of prepaid expenses and other, we refer to the information provided regarding the acquisition of Kichler.

From the notes, we see that the initial purchase price was $549 million, and the cash acquired was $2 million. Thus, the net purchase price before considering any other allocations is calculated as follows:

Net Purchase Price = Purchase Price - Cash Acquired  
Net Purchase Price = $549 million - $2 million = $547 million

Next, we observe that the allocation for ""prepaid expenses and other"" was $5 million in both the initial and revised estimates. However, since prepaid expenses are assets, they do not appear to reduce the net purchase price; instead, they are part of the total assets acquired.

Therefore, when considering the net purchase price and prepaid expenses, the calculation will still reflect the initial amount:

**Final Answer: The purchase price, net of prepaid expenses and other, remains $547 million.**"

Question: what was, then, the decline over the year?
Answer:",332.0,"To find the decline in operating leases from 2007 to 2008, we need to subtract the operating lease amount for 2008 from that of 2007.

Operating leases for 2007: 1703.0 (in thousands)  
Operating leases for 2008: 1371.0 (in thousands)  

Decline = Operating leases in 2007 - Operating leases in 2008  
Decline = 1703.0 - 1371.0  
Decline = 332.0 (in thousands)

Thus, the decline over the year was **332.0**.","To calculate the decline in operating leases from 2007 to 2008, we first need the amounts from each year.

- Operating leases in 2007: $1,703,000 (or 1703 in thousands)
- Operating leases in 2008: $1,371,000 (or 1371 in thousands)

Now, we find the decline by subtracting the amount in 2008 from the amount in 2007:

Decline = Operating leases in 2007 - Operating leases in 2008
Decline = $1,703,000 - $1,371,000
Decline = $332,000

Thus, the decline in operating leases from 2007 to 2008 was $332,000."

0.01111 × 100 = 1.111

Therefore, the answer is:

1.111","To answer the final question, we need to determine the values derived from the previous questions. 

1. **Net change in cash dividend for the period ended March 31, 2002, to the period ended March 31, 2003**:
   - For March 31, 2002, the dividend was $0.450.
   - For March 31, 2003, the dividend as declared on January 29, 2003, is also $0.455.
   - Thus, the net change is: 
     \[
     0.455 - 0.450 = 0.005
     \]

   Let's denote this result as **answer0 = 0.005**.

2. **That divided by the dividend payment in 2002**:
   - The dividend payment for March 31, 2002, is $0.450.
   - The calculation would be:
     \[
     \text{answer1} = \frac{0.005}{0.450} = \frac{5}{450} \approx 0.0111 \text{ (or } 1.11\% \text{)}
     \]

3. **Question: what is that by 100?**
   - Now we take the previous result, answer1, and multiply by 100:
     \[
     0.0111 \times 100 \approx 1.11
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is approximately **1.11**."

q0: what was the total increase in the other regulatory credits in 2003? 37.5
Question: and what percentage did this increase represent in relation to the net revenue in that year?
Answer:",0.03851,"To calculate the percentage increase of the other regulatory credits in relation to the net revenue for 2003, we can use the following formula:

\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Increase in Other Regulatory Credits}}{\text{Net Revenue}} \right) \times 100
\]

From the information provided:
- Increase in Other Regulatory Credits = $37.5 million
- 2003 Net Revenue = $973.7 million

Now substituting in the values:

\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{37.5}{973.7} \right) \times 100
\]

Calculating:

\[
\text{Percentage Increase} \approx 0.0385 \times 100 \approx 3.85\%
\]

Therefore, the increase in other regulatory credits in 2003 represented approximately **3.85%** of the net revenue that year.","To determine the total increase in other regulatory credits in 2003, we need to look at the details given in the context.

From context, the factors contributing to the other regulatory credits include:
- The deferral in 2004 of $14.3 million of capacity charges
- The amortization in 2003 of $11.8 million of deferred capacity charges
- The deferral in 2004 of $11.4 million related to Entergy's voluntary severance program

However, only the amortization in 2003 amount is relevant to our calculation for the increase in 2003 other regulatory credits, and that is $11.8 million.

1. So, the total increase in other regulatory credits in 2003 is **$11.8 million**.

Next, we need to calculate what percentage this increase represents in relation to the net revenue for that year, which is provided as:
- 2003 net revenue = $973.7 million.

To find the percentage:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Increase in Other Regulatory Credits}}{\text{Net Revenue}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting in the values:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{11.8}{973.7} \right) \times 100 \]

Calculating this:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} \approx (0.012115) \times 100 \approx 1.21\% \]

Thus, the increase in other regulatory credits represented approximately **1.21%** of the net revenue in 2003."

q0: what was the price of shares in february of 2009? 37.28
q1: and what was it in by the end of 2008? 28.85
q2: what was, then, the change over that period? 8.43
q3: what was the price of shares in the end of 2008? 28.85
Question: and how much does that change represent in relation to this 2008 price?
Answer:",0.2922,"To determine how much the change represents in relation to the 2008 price of $28.85, we can use the formula for percentage change:

\[
\text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{\text{Change}}{\text{Original Price}} \right) \times 100
\]

From the previous conversations, we know:

- Change = $8.43
- Original Price (End of 2008) = $28.85

Now, we can plug in these values:

\[
\text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{8.43}{28.85} \right) \times 100 \approx 29.26\%
\]

So, the change of $8.43 represents approximately **29.26%** of the stock price at the end of 2008 ($28.85).","To determine how much the change in share price from the end of 2008 to February 2009 represents in relation to the 2008 price, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the price at the end of 2008 (answer3):** From the provided context, the closing price at the end of the fourth quarter (December 31, 2008) is $37.28 per share.

2. **Identify the price in February 2009 (answer0):** The closing price on February 13, 2009, is $28.85 per share.

3. **Calculate the change in price (answer2):** 
   \[
   \text{Change} = \text{Price in February 2009} - \text{Price at end of 2008} 
   \]
   \[
   \text{Change} = 28.85 - 37.28 = -8.43
   \]

4. **Calculate the percentage change in relation to the 2008 price:**
   \[
   \text{Percentage Change} = \left(\frac{\text{Change}}{\text{Price at end of 2008}}\right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage Change} = \left(\frac{-8.43}{37.28}\right) \times 100 \approx -22.65\%
   \]

Thus, the change of -$8.43 represents approximately **-22.65%** in relation to the share price at the end of 2008."

Answer:",0.01665,"To find the difference between the percentage of total dividends from the first quarter in 2019 and 2018, we subtract the percentage for 2018 from that of 2019.

Percentage for 2019: 0.24017  
Percentage for 2018: 0.22353  

Difference:  
0.24017 - 0.22353 = 0.01664 

Therefore, the difference between the 2019 percentage and the 2018 percentage is **0.01664** or **1.664%**.","To determine the difference between the percentage of the total dividend in 2019 that is from the first quarter and the percentage of the total dividend in 2018 that is from the first quarter, we need to use the values derived from the previous questions.

From the data presented:

**Total Dividend for 2019:** $4.58  
**First Quarter Dividend for 2019:** $1.10  
**Total Dividend for 2018:** $4.25  
**First Quarter Dividend for 2018:** $0.95

Now, we calculate the percentage of the total dividend for each year that comes from the first quarter.

For **2019**:
\[
\text{Percentage for 2019} = \left(\frac{1.10}{4.58}\right) \times 100 \approx 24.0\%
\]

For **2018**:
\[
\text{Percentage for 2018} = \left(\frac{0.95}{4.25}\right) \times 100 \approx 22.4\%
\]

Now, we find the difference between the two percentages:
\[
\text{Difference} = 24.0\% - 22.4\% = 1.6\%

Thus, the difference between the 2019 percentage and the 2018 percentage is **1.6%**."

q2: in order to determine the number of shares that can be bought by each non-employee director, what would be the value that gets divided by this third of the fmv? 60000.0
Question: and what would be, then, that number of shares that can be bought?
Answer:",90.0,"To find the number of shares that can be bought by each non-employee director, we need to divide the value of 60,000 by the third of the fair market value (FMV) of a share.

From the previous question, we determined that one third of the FMV is 666.66667. 

Now, we perform the calculation:

Number of shares = 60,000 / (1/3 FMV)  
Number of shares = 60,000 / 666.66667  
Number of shares ≈ 90

Therefore, the number of shares that can be bought by each non-employee director is approximately **90 shares**.","To determine the number of shares that can be bought by each non-employee director, we need to follow these steps based on the information provided from the previous questions.

1. **Identifying the fair market value (FMV)**:
   - From question `q0`, we need the FMV of a share. In this context, let's assume the FMV provided or derived from previous answers.

2. **Calculating a third of the FMV**:
   - Based on question `q1`, we would calculate this by taking the FMV and dividing it by 3.

3. **Determining the number of shares based on the value**:
   - According to question `q2`, we have a fixed amount divided by this calculated third of the FMV. The fixed amount given before is $60,000 (as mentioned in the context in relation to the directors’ plan).

Using this information:
- Let's assume an FMV of $30 (as an example, since the specific FMV isn't provided in your queries). Therefore:
   - **Third of FMV** = $30 / 3 = $10.

Then:
- Now apply the amount from `q2`:
   - **Total amount to divide** = $60,000.

q0: what is the total number of securities approved by security holders? 4536446.0
q1: what about the number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options warrants and rights? 448859.0
Question: what proportion does this represent?
Answer:",0.09895,"To find the proportion of the number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants, and rights in relation to the total number of securities approved by security holders, we can use the following formula:

\[
\text{Proportion} = \frac{\text{Number of securities to be issued}}{\text{Total number of securities approved}} 
\]

From the previous responses:
- Number of securities to be issued upon exercise: 448,859
- Total number of securities approved by security holders: 4,536,446

Substituting the values into the formula:

\[
\text{Proportion} = \frac{448859}{4536446}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Proportion} \approx 0.0988 \text{ or } 9.88\%
\]

Therefore, the proportion that the number of securities to be issued represents is approximately **9.88%**.","To determine the proportion of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants, and rights compared to the total number of securities approved by security holders, we can use the provided figures.

1. The number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants, and rights (approved by security holders) is given as 448,859 (from answer1).
2. The total number of securities approved by security holders (as per the relevant information) is also 448,859, as per answer0.

Now we can calculate the proportion:

\[
\text{Proportion} = \frac{\text{Number of securities to be issued}}{\text{Total number of securities approved}} = \frac{448,859}{448,859} = 1
\]

Thus, the proportion represents 1, or 100%.

q1: including the 2001 program, what becomes this total liability? 12.8
Question: and what was the average liability between those three years?
Answer:",4.26667,"To find the average liability between the three programs (2001, 2003, and 2007) as of December 31, 2008, we first need to sum the liabilities of each program from the provided data:

- 2007 program liability at December 31, 2008: $1.2 million
- 2003 program liability at December 31, 2008: $5.7 million
- 2001 program liability at December 31, 2008: $5.9 million

Now, we calculate the total liability:

Total Liability = 2007 program + 2003 program + 2001 program  
Total Liability = $1.2 + $5.7 + $5.9  
Total Liability = $12.8 million

Next, we find the average liability over these three programs by dividing the total liability by the number of programs:

Average Liability = Total Liability / Number of Programs  
Average Liability = $12.8 million / 3  
Average Liability = $4.27 million (approximately)

Thus, the average liability between the three years is approximately **$4.27 million**.","To find the average liability between the three years (2007, 2008, and the initial liability for 2006), we first need to identify the total liability for each of these years for the three programs:

1. **Liability at December 31, 2006**: 
   - 2007 program: $2014 million 
   - 2003 program: $12.6 million 
   - 2001 program: $19.2 million 
   - Total: $2014 + $12.6 + $19.2 = $2045.8 million

2. **Liability at December 31, 2007**:
   - 2007 program: $11.9 million 
   - 2003 program: $9.0 million 
   - 2001 program: $8.7 million 
   - Total: $11.9 + $9.0 + $8.7 = $29.6 million

3. **Liability at December 31, 2008**:
   - 2007 program: $1.2 million 
   - 2003 program: $5.7 million 
   - 2001 program: $5.9 million 
   - Total: $1.2 + $5.7 + $5.9 = $12.8 million

Next, we summarize the total liabilities:
- Total liabilities for the three years:
   - 2006: $2045.8 million
   - 2007: $29.6 million
   - 2008: $12.8 million

Now, we calculate the average liability over these three years:
\[ 
\text{Average Liability} = \frac{\text{Total liability for 2006} + \text{Total liability for 2007} + \text{Total liability for 2008}}{3}
\]
\[ 
\text{Average Liability} = \frac{2045.8 + 29.6 + 12.8}{3} = \frac{2088.2}{3} \approx 696.07\, \text{million}

So, the average liability between those three years is approximately **$696.07 million**."

Answer:",-19.0,"To find out how much the total liability changed since the end of 2006 to the end of 2008, we will compare the total liabilities at those two points in time.

From the data provided:

- **Total liability at December 31, 2006:** $31.8 million
- **Total liability at December 31, 2008:** $12.8 million

Now, we calculate the change in total liability:

\[
\text{Change in total liability} = \text{Total liability at December 31, 2008} - \text{Total liability at December 31, 2006}
\]

\[
\text{Change in total liability} = 12.8 - 31.8 = -19.0 \text{ million}
\]

Thus, the total liability decreased by **$19.0 million** since the end of 2006.","To find out how much the total liability from the 2003 and 2007 programs changed since the end of 2006, we first need to calculate the total liabilities at the end of 2006 and at the end of 2008.

From the provided table:
- Liability at December 31, 2006 for the 2007 program: $2014 million
- Liability at December 31, 2006 for the 2003 program: $12.6 million
- Liability at December 31, 2006 for the 2001 program: $19.2 million

Total liability at the end of 2006:
\[
\text{Total Liability (2006)} = 2014 + 12.6 + 19.2 = 2045.8 \text{ million}
\]

Now, let's check the liabilities for the 2007 and 2003 programs at December 31, 2008:
- Liability at December 31, 2008 for the 2007 program: $1.2 million
- Liability at December 31, 2008 for the 2003 program: $5.7 million

Total liability at the end of 2008 for 2003 and 2007 programs:
\[
\text{Total Liability (2008 for 2007 and 2003)} = 1.2 + 5.7 = 6.9 \text{ million}
\]

Now, to find out the change in the total liability from December 31, 2006 to December 31, 2008:
\[
\text{Change in Total Liability} = \text{Total Liability (2008)} - \text{Total Liability (2006)}
\]
\[
\text{Change} = 6.9 - 2045.8 = -2038.9 \text{ million}

Thus, concerning the total liability from the 2003 and 2007 programs, it changed by **a decrease of $2038.9 million since the end of 2006**."

2. The price of the S&P 500 index in 2015 is 180.75.

Now, we calculate the net change:
- Net Change = Price in 2015 - Price in 2010
- Net Change = 180.75 - 100.0 = 80.75

Now, to find the ""change over 100"", we can express the net change as a fraction of the initial value (which is 100):
- Change Over 100 = (Net Change / Initial Value) * 100
- Change Over 100 = (80.75 / 100) * 100 = 80.75

q0: what was the net change in value of the nasdaq from 2017 to 2018? -6.27
q1: what was the 2017 value? 172.11
Question: what is the percent change?
Answer:",-0.03643,"To calculate the percent change in the value of the Nasdaq Composite Index from 2017 to 2018, we can use the formula for percent change:

\[
\text{Percent Change} = \left( \frac{\text{New Value} - \text{Old Value}}{\text{Old Value}} \right) \times 100
\]

From the previous queries, we have:
- Old Value (2017) = 172.11
- New Value (2018) = 165.84

Now we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[
\text{Percent Change} = \left( \frac{165.84 - 172.11}{172.11} \right) \times 100
\]
\[
= \left( \frac{-6.27}{172.11} \right) \times 100
\]
\[
= -3.64\%
\]

Thus, the percent change in the value of the Nasdaq Composite Index from 2017 to 2018 is approximately **-3.64%**.","To calculate the percent change in the value of the Nasdaq Composite Index from the end of 2017 to the end of 2018, we can use the following formula for percent change:

\[
\text{Percent Change} = \left( \frac{\text{New Value} - \text{Old Value}}{\text{Old Value}} \right) \times 100
\]

From the provided table, the value of the Nasdaq Composite Index at the end of 2017 is \(165.84\) and at the end of 2018 is \(165.84\).

Applying the values:

\[
\text{Percent Change} = \left( \frac{165.84 - 165.84}{165.84} \right) \times 100 = 0\%

Thus, the percent change in the value of the Nasdaq Composite Index from 2017 to 2018 is **0%**."

Question: what was the change in the return of the s&p 500 index from 2011 to 2016?
Answer:",78.0,"To determine the change in return of the S&P 500 index from 2011 to 2016, we can subtract the value at the beginning of the period (2011) from the value at the end of the period (2016).

The value for the S&P 500 index in 2011 was $100, and in 2016 it was $178.

Change in return = Value in 2016 - Value in 2011
Change in return = $178 - $100 = $78

Thus, the change in return of the S&P 500 index from 2011 to 2016 is $78.","To determine the change in the return of the S&P 500 index from 2011 to 2016, we can extract the values from the provided table:

- The return of the S&P 500 index in 2016 was $178.

Now, we can calculate the change in return:

Change = Return in 2016 - Return in 2011
Change = $178 - $100 = $78

Next, to find the change as a percentage of the return in 2011:

Percentage Change = (Change / Return in 2011) × 100
Percentage Change = ($78 / $100) × 100 = 78%

Therefore, the change in the return of the S&P 500 index from 2011 to 2016 was $78, representing a 78% increase."

q0: what was the difference in sold receivables between 2007 and 2008? 1.7
Question: so what was the percentage change over this time?
Answer:",0.10559,"To calculate the percentage change in sold receivables from 2007 to 2008, we can use the following formula:

\[
\text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{\text{New Value} - \text{Old Value}}{\text{Old Value}} \right) \times 100
\]

From the context, the total amount collected in sold receivables in 2007 was $16.1 billion, and in 2008 it was $17.8 billion.

Let's calculate the difference between the new value and the old value:

\[
\text{New Value} - \text{Old Value} = 17.8 \, \text{billion} - 16.1 \, \text{billion} = 1.7 \, \text{billion}
\]

Now we can plug these values into the percentage change formula:

\[
\text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{1.7 \, \text{billion}}{16.1 \, \text{billion}} \right) \times 100
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{1.7}{16.1} \right) \times 100 \approx 10.56\%
\]

Therefore, the percentage change in sold receivables from 2007 to 2008 was approximately **10.56%**.","To find the percentage change in sold receivables between 2007 and 2008, we first identify the amounts for each year.

From the context:
- Outstanding undivided interest held by investors in 2008: $584 million
- Outstanding undivided interest held by investors in 2007: $600 million

Now, let's calculate the difference in sold receivables:

Difference = Amount in 2008 - Amount in 2007
Difference = $584 million - $600 million = -$16 million

Next, we'll calculate the percentage change:

Percentage Change = (Difference / Amount in 2007) * 100
Percentage Change = (-$16 million / $600 million) * 100

Calculating this gives:

Percentage Change = -0.02667 * 100 = -2.67%

So the percentage change in sold receivables from 2007 to 2008 is approximately **-2.67%**."

Answer:",0.1115,"To find the change for the S&P 500 from 2001 to 2005 as a portion of its value in 2001, we can use the following formula:

\[
\text{Change as a portion of 2001 value} = \frac{\text{Change}}{\text{Value in 2001}}
\]

From the data:

- The value of the S&P 500 in 2001 (at December 29, 2001) was $100.00.
- The change from 2001 to 2005 is given as $11.15.

Thus, we can calculate:

\[
\text{Change as a portion of 2001 value} = \frac{11.15}{100} = 0.1115
\]

Therefore, the S&P 500 change as a portion of its value in 2001 is:

**0.1115 or 11.15%**.","To find the change in the S&P 500 value from 2001 to 2005 and express that change as a portion of its value in 2001, we’ll take the values from the table provided.

From the table, we have:

- S&P 500 value in 2001 (12/29/2001): **$100.00**
- S&P 500 value in 2005 (12/31/2005): **$116.61**

Now, we will calculate the change:

Change = Value in 2005 - Value in 2001  
Change = $116.61 - $100.00 = $16.61

Next, to express this change as a portion of its value in 2001, we will calculate the percentage:

Percentage of Change = (Change / Value in 2001) * 100  
Percentage of Change = ($16.61 / $100.00) * 100  
Percentage of Change = 16.61%

Thus, the S&P 500 change as a portion of its value in 2001 is **16.61%**."

q2: what is the sum? 33.0
Question: what is the average per year?
Answer:",16.5,"To calculate the average per year of the AAA interest rates for 2009 and 2008, we take the sum of the interest rates and divide it by the number of years:

Sum of rates = 33.0 (from q2)  
Number of years = 2

Average per year = Sum of rates / Number of years  
Average per year = 33.0 / 2 = 16.5

Thus, the average per year is **16.5**.","To calculate the average interest rate for the AAA category over the two years (2009 and 2008), we first need the interest rates from the previous queries.

From the provided context:
- The AAA interest rate in 2009 is **14%**.
- The AAA interest rate in 2008 is **19%**.

Now, we can sum these two interest rates and then divide by the number of years:

1. **Sum of interest rates:**  
   \( 14\% + 19\% = 33\% \)

2. **Number of years:**  
   \( 2 \)

3. **Average interest rate:**  
   \( \text{Average} = \frac{33\%}{2} = 16.5\% \)

Therefore, the average per year is **16.5%**."

q0: what was the cash dividend paid per common stock share in 2006? 40.0
q1: what is that divided by 100? 0.4
q2: what were total dividends paid in 2006? 41.0
Question: what is the total dividends paid over the quotient of dividends per share?
Answer:",102.5,"To find the total dividends paid over the quotient of dividends per share, we need to perform the following calculations:

1. **Total Dividends Paid in 2006**: $41.0 million (as provided in the context).
2. **Dividends Paid per Share in 2006**: $0.40 (from q0).
3. **Quotient of Total Dividends Paid by Dividends per Share**: 

\[
\text{Quotient} = \frac{\text{Total Dividends Paid}}{\text{Dividends per Share}} = \frac{41.0 \, \text{million}}{0.40} = 102.5 \, \text{million}
\]

Now, expressing it fully in the context of the question:

Since the question asks for the total dividends paid over the quotient, it means to confirm the dividend payment in relation to share representation. However, since the total is already represented as a relation over the single point of dividends per share, the final return is simply:

The total of dividends paid relative to the calculated quotient is confirmed to be consistent, providing a meaningful ratio derived earlier.

Thus, the answer to the question is:

**102.5 million.**","To find the answer, we first need the total dividends paid in 2006, which is $41 million (from answer2), and the cash dividend paid per common stock share in 2006, which is $0.40 (from answer0). 

Next, we need to divide the total dividends paid by the cash dividend per share:

\[
\text{Total Dividends Paid} \div \text{Dividends per Share} = 41,000,000 \div 0.40
\]

Calculating this gives us:

\[
41,000,000 \div 0.40 = 102,500,000
\]

So, the total dividends paid over the quotient of dividends per share is **102,500,000**."

q0: what was total operating income in 2013? 1.6
q1: what is that times 1000? 1600.0
Question: what is that less the operating income growth value in 2013?
Answer:",1492.0,"To find the operating income in 2013 less the operating income growth value in 2013, we first need to identify the operating income growth value.

From the context provided, we know that the operating income increased by $108 million from 2013 to 2014. This means the operating income in 2013 is:

Operating income in 2013 = Operating income in 2014 - Increase 
= $1.6 billion (or $1600 million) - $108 million 
= $1492 million.

Now, let's summarize the operating income in 2013:

Operating income in 2013 = $1492 million.

Next, to find the operating income in 2013 less the operating income growth value (which is $108 million):

Operating income in 2013 - Operating income growth value = $1492 million - $108 million = $1384 million.

Therefore, the final answer is:

**$1384 million.**","To answer your question, let's first confirm the values provided in the context for operating income.

From the table data:
- Operating income in 2013 is $318 million.

The operating income growth value from 2013 to 2014 is given as $108 million.

Now, we calculate the operating income in 2013 minus the operating income growth value:

\[
318 \, \text{million} - 108 \, \text{million} = 210 \, \text{million}

Therefore, the answer is:

q0: what is the sum of carrying value of notes due 2014 and 2015? 1750.0
Question: what is the sum including those due in 2017?
Answer:",2448.0,"To find the sum including notes due in 2014, 2015, and 2017, we need to extract the carrying values of the respective notes from the given table data:

- Notes due 2014: Carrying value = $1,000 million
- Notes due 2015: Carrying value = $750 million
- Notes due 2017: Carrying value = $698 million

Now, let's add these values together:

\[
\text{Sum} = \text{Carrying value of 2014} + \text{Carrying value of 2015} + \text{Carrying value of 2017}
\]

\[
\text{Sum} = 1,000 + 750 + 698 = 2,448 \text{ million}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

**$2,448 million**","To find the sum of the carrying value of the notes due in 2014, 2015, and 2017, we need to extract the carrying values from the provided information. 

From the table:

- Carrying value of the 3.50% notes due 2014: $1,000 million
- Carrying value of the 1.375% notes due 2015: $750 million
- Carrying value of the 6.25% notes due 2017: $698 million

Now, we can calculate the sum:

\[
1,000 + 750 + 698 = 2,448 \text{ million}
\]

Thus, the sum of the carrying values of the notes due in 2014, 2015, and 2017 is **$2,448 million**."

q3: what is the prior product less the amount operating revenues increased? 789.0
Question: what is that over the amount operating revenues increased?
Answer:",1.91971,"To find the answer to your question, we need to take the prior result (789.0) and divide it by the amount operating revenues increased (411.0).

So the calculation is:

\[ 
\frac{789.0}{411.0} \approx 1.916 \text{ (rounded to three decimal places)} 
\]

The final answer is approximately:

**1.916**","To find the answer to your question, we will need to start from the data provided.

From the information given:

- Operating Revenues in 2002 were $1.2 billion (or $1,200 million).
- The operating revenues increased by $411.0 million in 2002 compared to 2001.

Now, we need to answer the question: ""what is that over the amount operating revenues increased?""

This means we need to divide the Operating Revenues in 2002 by the increase in operating revenues:

\[
\text{Operating Revenues in 2002} \div \text{Increase in Operating Revenues}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
1,200 \, \text{million} \div 411 \, \text{million}
\]

Calculating that:

\[
\frac{1,200}{411} \approx 2.92
\]

Thus, the final answer is approximately **2.92**."

q0: in the year of 2007, what was the net income as a portion of the revenue? 0.0474
Question: and what was the change in that net income since 2006?
Answer:",56345.0,"To calculate the change in net income from 2006 to 2007, we first need the net income figures for both years:

- Net income for the year ended December 31, 2006: -$38,957 (which represents a net loss).
- Net income for the year ended December 30, 2007: $17,388.

Now we can calculate the change in net income:

Change in net income = Net income in 2007 - Net income in 2006
Change in net income = $17,388 - (-$38,957)
Change in net income = $17,388 + $38,957
Change in net income = $56,345.

Thus, the change in net income since 2006 is $56,345.","To find the net income as a portion of revenue for the year 2007, we can use the following information from the pro forma results:

- Revenue for 2007: $366,854,000
- Net income for 2007: $17,388,000

First, we calculate the net income as a portion of the revenue for 2007:

\[
\text{Net Income as a Portion of Revenue} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Revenue}} = \frac{17,388}{366,854} \approx 0.0474 \text{ or } 4.74\%
\]

Next, we determine the change in net income since 2006:

- Net income for 2006: -$38,957,000

Now, we calculate the change in net income from 2006 to 2007:

\[
\text{Change in Net Income} = \text{Net Income (2007)} - \text{Net Income (2006)} = 17,388 - (-38,957) = 17,388 + 38,957 = 56,345,000
\]

Thus, the change in net income since 2006 is $56,345,000.

Therefore, the answer is:
1. The net income as a portion of the revenue for the year 2007 is approximately 4.74%.
2. The change in net income since 2006 is $56,345,000."

q0: what was the beginning number of stores in 2012? 3576.0
q1: and what was the number of stores in the end of that year? 3460.0
q2: what was, then, the change in that number throughout the year? 116.0
q3: what was the ending number of stores in 2012? 3460.0
Question: and how much does that change represent in relation to this number?
Answer:",0.03353,"To find out how much the change in the number of stores (which is 116) represents in relation to the ending number of stores (3460) in 2012, we can use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{\text{Change in number of stores}}{\text{Ending number of stores}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{116}{3460} \right) \times 100
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Percentage Change} = \left( 0.03349 \right) \times 100 \approx 3.35\%
\]

Therefore, the change of 116 stores represents approximately **3.35%** of the ending number of stores (3460) in 2012.","To find how much the change in the number of stores in 2012 represents in relation to the ending number of stores, we can use the following steps:

1. **Determine the change in the number of stores**: From q2, we know that the change during 2012 was an increase of 116 new stores and a decrease of 4 closed stores. 

   Change = New Stores - Closed Stores 
   Change = 116 - 4 = 112

2. **Determine the ending number of stores**: From q3, the ending number of stores in 2012 is 3576.

3. **Calculate the percentage of the change relative to the ending number of stores**: 

   \[
   \text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{\text{Change}}{\text{Ending Stores}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{112}{3576} \right) \times 100 \approx 3.13\%
   \]

Therefore, the change of 112 stores represents approximately **3.13%** of the ending number of stores in 2012 (3576)."

q0: what is the amount of long-term debt due in 2014, in thousands? 385373.0
q1: and what is it for 2015, also in thousands? 1110566.0
q2: what is, then, in thousands, the total long-term debt due in those two years, combined? 1495939.0
q3: including the debt due in 2016, what then becomes this total? 1766791.0
Question: and how much is that in millions?
Answer:",1766.791,"To convert the total long-term debt due in 2016 and earlier years (which amounts to $1,766,791,000) into millions, you divide by 1,000.

So, 

\[
\text{Total debt in millions} = \frac{1,766,791}{1,000} = 1,766.791
\]

Therefore, the total long-term debt due is approximately **$1,766.79 million**.","To find the total long-term debt due in 2014, 2015, and 2016, we first use the amounts provided in the previous queries and table.

- Long-term debt due in 2014: $385,373 (in thousands)
- Long-term debt due in 2015: $1,110,566 (in thousands)
- Long-term debt due in 2016: $270,852 (in thousands)

Now, let's calculate the total long-term debt for these years in thousands:

\[
\text{Total} = 385373 + 1110566 + 270852 = 1,794,791 \text{ (in thousands)}
\]

Next, we need to convert this amount from thousands to millions. There are 1,000 thousands in a million, so we divide by 1,000:

\[
\text{Total in millions} = \frac{1794791}{1000} = 1,794.791 \text{ (in millions)}
\]

Now rounding to two decimal places, we can say:

**Answer:** 1,794.79 million."

q1: what is that divided by 1000000? 0.675

Answer:",12.675,"To find the answer, we need to add the number of shares not included in the repurchase plan (675,000) to the number of shares authorized for repurchase (12,000,000).

First, let's convert the number of shares not included in the plan into the same unit:

675,000 shares = 0.675 million shares (as answered in q1).

Now, let's calculate:

0.675 million shares + 12 million shares = 12.675 million shares.

Therefore, the answer is **12.675 million shares**.","To answer the final question, we need to find the number of shares not included in the repurchase plan, which is mentioned as 675,000 shares. 

Next, according to the previous data, the total number of shares authorized for repurchase is 12 million shares.

Now, we perform the calculation:

1. **Shares not included in the repurchase plan**: 675,000 shares
2. **Shares authorized for repurchase**: 12,000,000 shares

Now we add these two numbers:

675,000 + 12,000,000 = 12,675,000 shares

Therefore, the answer to the question ""what is that plus the number of shares authorized for repurchase?"" is:

**12,675,000 shares.**"

q3: so what was the difference between these two values that will be paid through the issuance of common stock? 3.78333
Question: and as a proportion of the total payout?
Answer:",0.67761,"To find the proportion of the amount paid through the issuance of common stock relative to the total payout, we first define the total payout and the amount paid through stock issuance.

1. **Total payout for the final milestone**: 
   - This consists of the cash payment and the stock issuance.
   - Cash payment: $1.8 million 
   - The remaining amount to be paid through stock issuance: $5,583,334 - $1,800,000 = $3,783,334

   **Total payout = Cash payment + Stock issuance = $1,800,000 + $3,783,334 = $5,583,334**

2. **Proportion of the amount paid through stock issuance**:
   - Amount paid through issuance of common stock: $3,783,334
   - Proportion = Amount paid through stock issuance / Total payout
   - Proportion = $3,783,334 / $5,583,334 ≈ 0.678 (rounded to three decimal places)

Thus, the proportion of the amount paid through the issuance of common stock as part of the total payout is approximately **67.8%**.","To answer the question regarding the proportion of the amount paid through the issuance of common stock in relation to the total payout, let's break down the relevant amounts:

1. **Total payout related to the milestones for Impella**:
   - Payment for the Impella 2.5 device approval: $5,583,333
   - Payment for the sale of 1,000 units of Impella products: $5,583,334
   - Payment upon FDA approval of the Impella 5.0 device: $5,583,333

   Total without the cash payment already made = $5,583,333 + $5,583,334 + $5,583,333 = $16,750,000

2. **Cash paid for the Impella 5.0 device milestone**: $1,800,000

3. **Remaining amount to be paid via common stock**:
   - Total required for FDA approval of the Impella 5.0 device: $5,583,333
   - Cash paid: $1,800,000
   - Remaining amount: $5,583,333 - $1,800,000 = $3,783,333

4. **Proportion of the issuance of common stock to the total payout**:
   - Amount paid through stock issuance: $3,783,333
   - Total payout: $16,750,000

   To find the proportion:
   \[
   \text{Proportion} = \frac{\text{Amount through common stock}}{\text{Total payout}} = \frac{3,783,333}{16,750,000}
   \]

   Calculating this gives:
   \[
   \text{Proportion} = 0.225 (or 22.5\%)
   \]

Thus, the answer is that the amount paid through the issuance of common stock is **approximately 22.5% of the total payout**."

q2: what is the net change? 0.3
Question: what percentage change does this represent?
Answer:",0.45455,"To calculate the percentage change, you can use the following formula:

\[
\text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{\text{New Value} - \text{Old Value}}{\text{Old Value}} \right) \times 100
\]

In this case:

- New Value (2007 dividend): 0.96
- Old Value (2006 dividend): 0.66

Plugging in the values:

\[
\text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{0.96 - 0.66}{0.66} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{0.30}{0.66} \right) \times 100 \approx 45.45\%

Thus, the percentage change represents approximately **45.45%**.","To find the percentage change in expected annual dividends per share from 2006 to 2007:

1. **Identify the values:**
   - Expected annual dividends per share in 2006: $0.80 (from answer1)
   - Expected annual dividends per share in 2007: $0.96 (from answer0)

2. **Calculate the net change:**
   \[
   \text{Net Change} = \text{Value in 2007} - \text{Value in 2006} = 0.96 - 0.80 = 0.16

q0: what was the amount paid from the long-term debt after the discounts and debt issuance costs, in millions? 6.9
Question: what was, then, the value of those discounts and debt issuance costs, also in millions?
Answer:",0.1,"To calculate the value of the discounts and debt issuance costs related to the issuance of the November 2015 notes, we refer to the net proceeds received from the offering and the total amount issued.

1. The total amount issued for the November 2015 notes was $7.0 billion.
2. The net proceeds received from the offering, after deducting discounts and debt issuance costs, was $6.9 billion.

Now, we find the value of the discounts and debt issuance costs:

Total amount issued - Net proceeds = Discounts and debt issuance costs

\[
7.0 \text{ billion} - 6.9 \text{ billion} = 0.1 \text{ billion} = 100 \text{ million}
\]

Therefore, the value of the discounts and debt issuance costs was **100 million**.","The value of the discounts and debt issuance costs can be calculated using the total long-term debt and the net long-term debt figures provided.

From the table:

- Total long-term debt (2015): $16,296 million
- Total long-term debt net (after discounts and deferred financing costs): $15,261 million

To find the value of the discounts and debt issuance costs, we subtract the net long-term debt from the total long-term debt:

\[
\text{Discounts and debt issuance costs} = \text{Total long-term debt} - \text{Total long-term debt net}
\]
\[
\text{Discounts and debt issuance costs} = 16,296 - 15,261 = 1,035
\]

Therefore, the value of the discounts and debt issuance costs, also in millions, is **$1,035 million**."

Answer:",108.1,"To find the fluctuation in the total return of the S&P 500 for the five-year period ended December 31, 2017, we’ll start with the returns at the beginning and end of the period specified in the table:

1. **Return at the beginning of the period (December 31, 2012)**: 100.0
2. **Return at the end of the period (December 31, 2017)**: 208.1

Now, we calculate the fluctuation:

\[

\]
\[
\text{Fluctuation} = 208.1 - 100.0 = 108.1

Thus, the fluctuation in the total return of the S&P 500 for the five-year period ended 2017 is **108.1**.","To find the fluctuation in the total return of the S&P 500 index over the five-year period ended 2017, we will examine the values from the table provided.

The cumulative total return for the S&P 500 index at the beginning (31-Dec-2012) and end (31-Dec-2017) of the period is as follows:

- **S&P 500 return on 31-Dec-2012**: 100.0
- **S&P 500 return on 31-Dec-2017**: 208.1

Now, let's calculate the fluctuation:

1. **Fluctuation** = Return at end of period - Return at beginning of period
   - Fluctuation = 208.1 - 100.0 = 108.1

Next, we will compute the fluctuation as a percentage of the return in 2012:

2. **Percentage fluctuation** = (Fluctuation / Return at beginning of period) × 100
   - Percentage fluctuation = (108.1 / 100.0) × 100 = 108.1%

Thus, the fluctuation for the S&P 500 index in that same period was 108.1."

q0: what is the buy/sell volume in 2006? 24.0
q1: what is the value in 2005? 77.0
Question: what is the sum of those two years?
Answer:",101.0,"The sum of the buy/sell volumes from 2006 and 2005 is:

24.0 (2006) + 77.0 (2005) = 101.0

Therefore, the answer is 101.0.","To find the sum of the buy/sell volume in 2006 and the value in 2005 from the previously provided information, let’s extract the data:

1. The buy/sell volume in 2006 is 24 mbpd (as mentioned in the provided table).
2. The value in 2005, according to the average sales price per barrel, is $66.42 (from the table).

Now, let’s compute the total volume for the two measurements:

- **Sum of volumes**:
  - Buy/Sell Volume (2006): 24 mbpd
  - Value (2005): $66.42 per barrel 

However, it seems we need to clarify what ""value"" refers to in ""the value in 2005."" If you intend to have the total monetary amount from the sales or another calculated figure, we typically need volume in barrels or mbpd and average price to compute revenue.

**Clarifying Steps for Calculation**:
1. If we consider the value of sales from the volumes:
   - The buy/sell volume represents a physical quantity (volume), hence it can't be summed directly with the revenue figure (price). 

Instead, let's clarify our calculation:
- It would be improper to directly sum a volume with a price; thus, we can carry the value in terms of production. 

So, concluding just the buy/sell volume for 2006 is **24 mbpd** but we don't have a direct computation between that volume and 2005 for calculating profits or revenues inherently.

If you are referring to a specific kind of calculation (like total revenues for each period), that clarification would be needed to supply the answer properly.

Final answer with respect to the idea of volume-added context isn't directly applicable—but you could say that you know the numbers to work from! In which case I could affirm:
The buy/sell volume in 2006 is 24 mbpd, and relevant volumetric figures reflect a distinction in extraction.

Thus just to clarify, any direct arithmetic addition would not generally yield a relevant approach between the two stated figures without proper context of the figures involved (volume versus revenue)."

q0: what was the annual performance of the jkhy stock in 2010? 116.85
q1: and what was it in 2009? 100.0
Question: what was, then, the change in that performance over the year?
Answer:",16.85,"To calculate the change in the performance of JKHY stock from 2009 to 2010, we subtract the 2009 performance from the 2010 performance:

Performance in 2010 = 116.85  
Performance in 2009 = 100.00  

Change in performance = Performance in 2010 - Performance in 2009  
Change in performance = 116.85 - 100.00  
Change in performance = 16.85  

Thus, the change in JKHY stock performance over the year from 2009 to 2010 was **16.85**.","To determine the change in performance of the JKHY stock from 2009 to 2010, we can use the values provided in the table for those years:

- In 2009, the value of JKHY stock was 100.00.
- In 2010, the value of JKHY stock was 116.85.

Now, we can calculate the change in performance:

1. **Calculate the change in value:**
   \[
   \text{Change} = \text{Value in 2010} - \text{Value in 2009} = 116.85 - 100.00 = 16.85
   \]

2. **Calculate the percentage change:**
   \[
   \text{Percentage Change} = \left( \frac{\text{Change}}{\text{Value in 2009}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{16.85}{100.00} \right) \times 100 = 16.85\%
   \]

Therefore, the change in performance of the JKHY stock from 2009 to 2010 was an increase of 16.85%."
