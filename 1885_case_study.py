üîç CoT Analysis Result:

To solve the final question step by step, we will proceed according to the steps outlined.

### Step 1: Identify the relevant financial figures from the provided data.
- From the data, we need to extract the high and low sale prices of the company's common stock during the first quarter of both 2001 and 2002. 
- The relevant figures for the first quarter of each year are:
  - **2001**: High = $60.15, Low = $41.30
  - **2002**: High = $17.84, Low = $4.11 
- These numbers are relevant as we are tasked with calculating the variance in the price of shares, which involves understanding the range of stock prices (i.e., the difference between the high and low prices) during those periods.

### Step 2: Determine the appropriate formula.
- The variance can be calculated by finding the price range, expressed as:
  \[
  \text{Price Range} = \text{High Price} - \text{Low Price}
  \]
- We will apply this formula to the respective years to find the price variance in the first quarter of 2001.

### Step 3: Compute the result.
- **For 2001**:
  \[
  \text{Price Range}_{2001} = \text{High}_{2001} - \text{Low}_{2001} = 60.15 - 41.30 = 18.85
  \]
- So, the variance in the price of shares in the first quarter of 2001 is **$18.85**.

### Step 4: Explain the role of the conversation history.
- The information provided in the previous question mentions that the variance in the price of shares in the first quarter of 2002 was $13.73. This insight provides a direct context about share performance over the years and allows for comparative analysis. 
- The reasoning that allows us to extend from the information in the previous question to our current question involves recognizing that we are using the same calculation method as before (i.e., determining the price range of share prices) but applying it to a different year. By applying consistent logic across these questions, we can derive their respective variances to understand stock performance more clearly.
